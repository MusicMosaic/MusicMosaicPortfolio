                    <p class="research-text">Electronic music is a broad genre that primarily involves the use of electronic devices and technology to create sound. Emerging in the mid-20th century, it encompasses a wide range of styles, including techno, house, trance, drum and bass, and ambient music. Characterized by synthesized sounds, beats, and samples, electronic music often features rhythmic patterns and textures that distinguish it from traditional acoustic genres.</p>

                    <p class="research-text">Heavy metal is a genre of rock music characterized by its loud, aggressive sound, heavy use of distorted electric guitars, powerful drumming, and strong vocals, often with a theatrical or rebellious edge. Emerging in the late 1960s and early 1970s, heavy metal drew influences from blues rock, psychedelic rock, and hard rock. Key elements include complex guitar solos, dark themes, and a strong emphasis on rhythm.</p>

                      <h1 class="headline headline-1 section-title">Camera Angles and Movements</h1>
                      <div class="footer-top"></div>
                      <br>
                      <div class="content">
                        <p class="research-text">
                          The way the camera is used is extremely important in producing meaning within a music video. The angles and movements can help create different effects. The shots are what make the video unique. Below are different shots and movements:
                        </p>
                  
                        <ul class="research-text">
                          <li><strong>Very Wide Shot:</strong> Used to show the audience where the artist is, but the emphasis is still on the artist in front of the setting or location.</li>
                          <li><strong>Wide Shot:</strong> Focuses on the artist while still allowing the audience to see the location of the video.</li>
                          <li><strong>Mid Shot:</strong> Shows the artist from their waist to the head, focusing mainly on the subject but still giving a feel for the location and setting.</li>
                          <li><strong>Medium Shot:</strong> Halfway between a mid shot and a close-up, showing the artist’s chest and head.</li>
                          <li><strong>Close-up:</strong> Shows the artist’s face or an object in detail; this shot can reveal more about the mise-en-scène as facial expressions, color, and makeup contribute towards the video.</li>
                          <li><strong>Extreme Close-up:</strong> Focuses closely on the artist’s face (e.g., eyes, nose, lips) to identify something or to add meaning and effect to the video. It can also show that the video is lip-synced.</li>
                          <li><strong>Over-the-Shoulder Shot:</strong> This shot is effective in narrative-based music videos as it gives the perspective of the artist's view while including them in it. It can also be used as a shot-reverse-shot if the artist is having a conversation with someone.</li>
                          <li><strong>Cut-ins:</strong> Often used to match the lyrics within the music video. If something is said within a song, for example, an object is described, the object may then come into view.</li>
                        </ul>
                  
                        <p class="research-text">
                          Just like movements, camera angles significantly impact the meaning and style of the music video. Wherever a camera is placed can show the power of the artist/characters or sometimes show an exact location from which we should be seeing it. By choosing different angles, the viewers gain different perspectives on the action, which makes it more interesting.
                        </p>
                  
                        <p class="research-text">
                          An example of this is <strong>"Salute"</strong> by Little Mix, which showcases various angles and movements, particularly from a low angle, demonstrating the power the girls need to overcome issues of equality. The music video features a lot of different angles and movements, particularly from a low angle view, which helps convey the message of empowerment.
                        </p>

                      <div class="content">
                        <p class="research-text">
                          Different camera movements can be used to add effects to music videos. Examples of camera movements are:
                        </p>
                  
                        <ul class="research-text">
                          <li><strong>Pans:</strong> This occurs when the camera scans the scene horizontally. The camera is usually placed on a tripod, and the camera is turned to follow the object which is typically situated in the middle of the screen.</li>
                          <li><strong>Dolly or Tracking Shots:</strong> This is where the camera is mounted on a cart that travels along a smooth track to follow the action.</li>
                        </ul>
                  
                        <p class="research-text">
                          Just like in any other form of video media, certain camera movements are used for different reasons; an establishing shot will generally set the scene at the beginning; a long shot will normally set out the location of a closer scene, allowing the audience to better understand the atmosphere; mid shots and close-ups will be used to see the artist's face and emotions depending on the music style.
                        </p>
                  
                        <p class="research-text">
                          For example, <strong>"Hollaback Girl"</strong> by Gwen Stefani features various tracking and panning shots which are both slow and fast. This gives the music video a dynamic energy because they are always on the move, presenting the artist in a lively way and providing a visual narrative that keeps the audience engaged.
                        </p>

                      <div class="content">
                        <p class="research-text">
                          When editing, various techniques are utilized to enhance the video and give it a professional feel. Common editing techniques include transitions such as fade to black, green screen effects, and adjustments to lighting, contrast, and brightness.

                          <li>Cross-Cutting: Back and forth between locations (e.g., phone call).</li>
                          <li>Jump Cuts: Disjointed edits in the same shot or action.</li>

                        <p class="research-text">
                          Music videos incorporate two types of sound: diegetic and non-diegetic. Diegetic sound is naturally present in the video, while non-diegetic sound is added during editing. Sound can be edited to create different effects and variations in the artist's vocals.
